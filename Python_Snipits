Just some snipits of code to remember. 

Much thanks to http://stackoverflow.com/ where lots of my questions get answered! 

#### Flattening a List in Python ####

So I am holding the LED values in a list of lists like this

LED = [[0xEF, 255, 255, 255], [0xEF, 135, 234, 111], [0xEF, 244, 75, 128]]

This makes it easy to address and indivual LED in the strip with out affecting any others. So if I want the second LED in the strip to 
be blue and full brightness I can say LED[1] = [0xFF, 255, 0, 0]

But when writing to the LED strip using SPIdev this woule mean looping through the LED list and sending each in turn. However 
this is time consuming it would be nicer to send it as a single command which i could do it i convert it to a single flat list 
which the following line of code does. 

LEDs = [item for sublist in LED for item in sublist]

thank you to stack overflow. (http://stackoverflow.com/a/952952/726150) 
as this post explaings there are other ways to achive the same but this is an order of magnitiude faster than the rest. 300usec vs 4msec on the raspberry pi

and give an output of 

LEDs = 0xEF, 255, 255, 255, 0xEF, 135, 234, 111, 0xEF, 244, 75, 128

which i can then tag a start and end frame to and write to the SPi bus



#### Reading a single char ####

pip install readchar
Usage:

import readchar
print("Reading a char:")
print(repr(readchar.readchar()))
print("Reading a key:")
print(repr(readchar.readkey())) 


### rounding up a number ####

I wanted to round up a number to the nearest int. 

The ceil (ceiling) function:

import math
print math.ceil(4.2)
